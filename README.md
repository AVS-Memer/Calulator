# Calulator
You input the type of calculation you want (n / p)
# n
numeric calculation
# p
polynomial calculation
# t
trignometric calculation
# Numeric Calculation:
You input 1 or 2 numbers and an operator, and it will calculate the answer
# 2 Number Operators:
# +
Adds 2 numbers
# -
Subtracts 2 numbers
# *
Multiplies 2 numbers
# /
Divides 2 numbers, asks if the answer should have remainder or decimal format
# %
Finds one number percent of the other number
# ^
Raises a number to the power of another number
# R
Rounds a number to the nearest multiple of another number
# 1 Number Operations:
# ++
Adds 1 to a number
# --
Subtracts 1 from a number
# %
Finds the percentage of a number
# *2
Doubles a number
# *3
Triples a number
# /2
Finds the half of a number, asks if the answer shought have remainder or decimal format
# ^2
Squares a number
# ^3
Cubes a number
# \\/
Gets the floor of a number; rounds it down
# /\\
Gets the ceiling of a number; rounds it up
# R
Rounds a number to the nearest integer
# Polynomial Calculation
# Linear Calculation
Input the coefficient of the x term and the constant
# s
Outputs the slope
# x
Outputs the x intercept
# y
Outputs the y intercept
# Quadratic Calculation
Inputs the coefficient of the x² term, the coefficient of the x term, and the constant
If the x² coefficient is 0, it will give you an error and you should put it in the linear function
# a
Outputs the axis of symettery
# m
Outputs the minimum/maximum value
# v
Outputs the vertex coordinate
# x
Outputs the x intercepts
# y
Outputs the y intercept
# Trignometric calculation
# c
Triangle Classification
# f
Trignometry Functions
# Triangle Classification
choose how to classify the triangle: a s b
# a
Classify by angle. Input 2 or 3 of the angles in degrees, and it will find out if the triangle is acute, right, or obtuse
# s
Classify by side. Input the lengths of the 3 sides, and it will find out if the triangle is scalene, isosceles, or equilateral
# b
Classify by both angle and side. Input 2 or 3 angles in degrees and the lengths of the 3 sides, and it will find out if the triangle is acute, right, or obtuse and if it's scalene, isosceles, or equilateral
# Trignometry Functions
Input the function and the angle in degrees. You could type the abbriviation, or the full name. sin: sine, cos: cosine, tan: tangent, sec: secant, csc: cosecant, cot: cotangent.
To use inverse functions, you would give the abbriviation the prefix arc, or type the word inverse in front of the function name
